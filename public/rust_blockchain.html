                <p>This project placed a greater emphasis on learning compared to my earlier projects, which were more
                    about solving specific problems. Having completed rustlings and other work in Rust, this endeavor
                    was the first time the language began to click for me, allowing me to apply it effectively.
                    Additionally, I deepened my understanding of blockchain technology and how it employs cryptography
                    to establish trustless systems. Consequently, Rust has become my preferred language, and I am
                    excited to build more with it in the future.
