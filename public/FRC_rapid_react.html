        <p>This project was my first expirence programming in Java, where I worked on a robot capable of performing
          various tasks in a competitive environment.</p>

        <h3>Robot Capabilities:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Ball Handling:</b> Picking up and shooting balls into designated hoops.</li>
          <li><b>Climbing:</b> Ability to climb on a bars and pull its self up.</li>
          <li><b>Extendable Intake System:</b> Extendable intake mechanism designed for rapid and efficient ball pick-up
            and manipulation.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Features:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Image Tracking with OpenCV:</b> Implementing image recognition to augment robot navigation and task
            execution.</li>
          <li><b>Autonomous Programs:</b> Developing programs for autonomous robot operation, allowing for sophisticated
            maneuvers without direct control.</li>
          <li><b>Safety and Efficiency:</b> Utilizing an array of IR sensors as limit switches to enhance safety and
            control.
          </li>
          <li><b>Limelight:</b> Integrating Limelight for enhanced targeting, enabling the robot to
            automatically align with goals and adjusting power settings for precise ball shooting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Java Programming: Gaining a foundational understanding of Java in a practical, project-based environment.
          </li>
          <li>Robotics Integration: Learning how to integrate hardware and software for complex robotic tasks.</li>
          <li>Team Collaboration: Working within a team to develop, test, and refine robotic functionalities.</li>
          <li>Image Processing and Recognition with OpenCV: Acquired knowledge in advanced image processing techniques
            using OpenCV for real-time robotic applications.</li>
        </ol>
