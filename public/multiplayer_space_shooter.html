        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>Our Multiplayer Space Shooter is a simple 2D spaceship shooter based on the game Asteroids. The project was
          created using JavaScript and the Socket.io library. It was a collaborative effort between me and two other
          friends.</p>


        <h3>My Contribution:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Front-End Development: Designing the user interface and developing a single-player proof of concept.</li>
          <li>Game Mechanics: Assisted in the development of the game mechanics and design.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Team Efforts:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Tutorial Creation: Zachary Zabel focused on developing an engaging and informative game tutorial.</li>
          <li>Back-End Development: William Franco handled server-side logic and game hosting, ensuring smooth
            multiplayer experiences.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Game Features:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Retro Control Scheme:</b> Emulating the classic 'Asteroids' game for an intuitive and nostalgic feel.

            games, using Socket.io.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Front-End Game/Web Development</li>
          <li>Collaborative Project Management</li>
          <li>Real-time Multiplayer Game Mechanics</li>

        <p>The project's codebase is currently inaccessible, as it resides on a team member's personal desktop. This
          project was completed 3 years ago, and I am in the process of retrieving the code to upload it to GitHub.</p>
