        <h2>Introduction to FRC Java Framework</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>The FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) Java Framework is a powerful tool for programming robots to compete
          in various challenges. It provides developers with a structured environment to create, test, and deploy code
          that controls robot movements, sensors, and interactions.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Integration with WPILib: WPILib is a library specifically designed for FRC robot programming, offering
            a range of functions to control motors, sensors, and communication.</li>
          <li>Object-Oriented Programming: FRC Java Framework encourages the use of object-oriented principles,
            allowing teams to build modular and maintainable code.</li>
          <li>Sensor Integration: Easily interface with various sensors such as encoders, gyros, and cameras to
            enhance robot capabilities.</li>
          <li>Teleop and Autonomous Modes: Develop code for both operator-controlled and autonomous modes to perform
            specific tasks during competitions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>To begin using the FRC Java Framework:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Set up your development environment with the required software, including the Java Development Kit (JDK)
            and the FRC tools.</li>
          <li>Create a new project using the FRC Java template. This template includes necessary files and
            configurations to get you started quickly.</li>
          <li>Explore the WPILib documentation to understand available classes and methods for robot control.</li>
          <li>Write code for teleop and autonomous modes, implementing logic for controlling motors, sensors, and other
            robot components.</li>
          <li>Test your code on a robot simulator or deploy it to a physical robot for real-world testing.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Advanced Tips</h3>
        <p>As you become more proficient with the FRC Java Framework:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Utilize PID controllers for precise control of motor movements.</li>
          <li>Implement vision processing using cameras and OpenCV for tasks like target tracking.</li>
          <li>Practice good code organization by separating logic into different classes and methods.</li>
          <li>Collaborate with your team to divide tasks and streamline development.</li>
        </ul>
